 Once there was 3 little pigs and one day they saw a big bad wolf, he said he will blow their house down, so the first pig built a house made of straw so the Big bad wolf huffed and
 puffed and blew his house down. The first pig ran to the second pigs house. The second pig built his house out of sticks, so the Big bad wolf huffed and puffed and blew his house
 down. The first and the second pig ran to the third pigs house. The third pig built his house made of bricks, the Big bad wolf huffed and puffed but he couldn't blow the third pigs
 house down, the three pigs lived happy ever after. THE END
